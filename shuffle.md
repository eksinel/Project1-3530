# Shuffling Logic and Seed Usage Instructions

In this instruction, you will generate shuffled input arrays for runtime
analysis of algorithms. It's important to ensure that the shuffling process is
controlled using a seed to make it reproducible, allowing for consistent
results across multiple runs. Follow these steps to implement the shuffling
logic and use the seed effectively:

1. **Include the Necessary Headers:** In your C++ code, include the necessary
headers for working with random numbers and shuffling:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <random>
```

2. **Setting Up the Seed:** Choose a seed value that will serve as the starting
point for generating random numbers. This seed value should be constant if you
want to reproduce the same sequence of random numbers across different runs of
your program. For example:

```cpp
unsigned int seed = 42; // Choose any integer as the seed
```

3. **Shuffling Process:** Before measuring the runtime of your sorting
algorithms, you will shuffle the input array to ensure that the data
distribution is random and unbiased. Here's how you can do it:

```cpp
std::vector<int> arr(size);
for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
    arr[i] = i + 1;
}

// Shuffle the array using the seed
std::shuffle(arr.begin(), arr.end(), std::default_random_engine(seed));
```

In this code, `arr` is an array containing integers from 1 to `size`. The
`std::shuffle` function takes care of shuffling the elements using the provided
seed value.

4. **Using Reproducible Shuffled Data:** When you need to recreate the exact
same shuffled data for validation or further analysis, make sure to use the
same seed value. This will ensure that the random sequence generated by the
random number generator remains consistent:

```cpp
// Re-shuffle the array using the same seed
std::shuffle(arr.begin(), arr.end(), std::default_random_engine(seed));
```

By consistently using the same seed value, you can reproduce the exact shuffled
data in subsequent runs.

5. **Compile and Run:** Compile your code and run the program. You should
notice that the shuffled data remains the same across multiple runs, provided
you use the same seed value.
